### Key Points
- The #vibejam, hosted by @levelsio, is likely the "2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam," a game jam for AI-assisted game development, with a submission deadline of April 1, 2025.  
- It seems open to anyone, requiring games to be multiplayer, web-accessible, and mostly coded by AI (at least 80%).  
- The evidence leans toward judges including notable figures like @karpathy and @levelsio, with sponsors like boltdotnew and coderabbitai, but specific prizes for participants are not detailed.  
- An unexpected detail is a separate $5,000 prize for the best event website, not for the games themselves.

### Event Overview
The #vibejam, hosted by @levelsio, appears to be the "2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam," focused on creating AI-assisted multiplayer games. It’s open to all, with a deadline of April 1, 2025, and games must be web-accessible, free-to-play, and coded at least 80% by AI, preferably using ThreeJS. Participants are encouraged to share progress on X with the hashtag #vibejam.

### Judging and Sponsorship
The judging panel likely includes figures like @karpathy, @levelsio, @timsoret, @mrdoob, and @s13k_, with sponsors such as boltdotnew and coderabbitai. However, specific prize details for the game jam are not publicly available, adding some uncertainty to the event’s rewards.

### Additional Competition
Interestingly, there’s a separate competition offering a $5,000 prize for the best website created for the #vibejam, which is distinct from the game jam itself. This highlights the event’s broader organizational efforts.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Details on #vibejam Hosted by @levelsio

The #vibejam, hosted by @levelsio, is identified as the "2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam," a pioneering event described as the first game jam dedicated to AI vibecoded games. This initiative, centered around game development with significant AI assistance, has garnered attention for its unique focus and structure. Below, we detail the event’s key aspects, drawing from various online sources to provide a thorough overview.

#### Event Description and Participation
The event is titled "2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam" and is open to anyone interested in game development, making it accessible to a wide audience. The core concept, "AI vibecoded games," suggests a focus on games where at least 80% of the code is generated or assisted by AI, aligning with the trend of leveraging artificial intelligence in creative processes. The term "vibe coding" is not explicitly defined in the sources, but it likely refers to a development approach where AI tools help translate the developer’s creative vision into code, emphasizing intuition and innovation over traditional documentation.

Participants are required to create multiplayer games, ensuring interactivity and engagement. The games must be web-accessible, meaning they should be playable online without requiring users to log in or sign up, and they must be free-to-play to maximize accessibility. Preferably, games should be hosted on their own domain or subdomain for ease of access and branding, though this is not mandatory.

#### Technical Requirements and Recommendations
To maintain a seamless user experience, the event imposes specific technical rules: games should have no loading screens and avoid heavy downloads, ensuring they are almost instantly playable, with the possible exception of asking for a username. The recommended game engine is ThreeJS, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics, which likely facilitates the creation of web-based, multiplayer games and aligns with the AI-coding focus.

#### Timeline and Submission
The submission deadline for the game jam is April 1, 2025, providing participants with a clear timeframe to develop and submit their entries. The exact submission method is not detailed in the available information, but participants are directed to submit through the event website ([2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam](https://vibejam-site.vercel.app/)). Additionally, participants are encouraged to share their development journey on X using the hashtag #vibejam, fostering community engagement and visibility.

#### Judging and Sponsors
The judging panel comprises notable figures in the tech and gaming communities, including @karpathy, @levelsio, @timsoret, @mrdoob, and @s13k_. These individuals bring expertise and credibility to the evaluation process, though specific judging criteria are not outlined. The event also benefits from sponsorships, with boltdotnew and coderabbitai confirmed as sponsors, as mentioned in an X post by @levelsio ([X post](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1903825859175154000)). These sponsorships suggest financial support, potentially for prizes or event organization, though specific prize details for the game jam itself are not provided in the sources.

#### Prizes and Additional Competitions
While specific prizes for the game jam participants are not detailed, there is evidence of related financial incentives. Notably, a separate competition offers a $5,000 prize for the best website created for the #vibejam, as highlighted in posts on the WIP project page ([Vibe Coding Game Jam on WIP](https://wip.co/projects/vibejam)) and an X post by @levelsio ([X post](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1904280455534256460)). This website competition, with a deadline around March 25, 2025, is distinct from the game jam and focuses on event promotion rather than game development.

Additionally, external initiatives like the Websim Pre-Jam, mentioned in X posts by @websim_ai ([X post](https://x.com/websim_ai/status/1902875209205682429)), offer $1,000 in cash prizes for top submissions, positioning themselves as preparatory for the #vibejam. Another X post by @vapormensch ([X post](https://x.com/vapormensch/status/1903532014583832706)) mentions offering $500 for the highest score in their specific #vibejam game, indicating individual contributions to the prize pool but not reflecting official game jam prizes.

The sponsorship details from the WIP project page include a Gold Sponsor slot sold for $25,000 to Lambda.chat and a Title sponsorship to bolt.new, with an unsuccessful attempt to sell another $25,000 sponsorship due to legal issues in Singapore. These financial arrangements suggest that the event has significant backing, potentially funding prizes, but no explicit prize structure for the game jam is available.

#### Community and Organizational Insights
The event is being built in public, as evidenced by updates on the WIP project page ([Vibe Coding Game Jam on WIP](https://wip.co/projects/vibejam)), where @levelsio shares progress, such as extending the deadline and managing sponsorships. X posts by @levelsio also clarify misunderstandings, such as distinguishing between the website competition and the game jam itself, ensuring transparency ([X post](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1904301037361787350)). This public development approach fosters community involvement and provides insights into the event’s organization, though it does not add further details on prizes.

#### Conclusion
The #vibejam hosted by @levelsio is a significant event in the game development community, emphasizing AI-assisted creation and multiplayer engagement. While detailed prize information for the game jam is absent, the event’s structure, sponsorships, and additional competitions like the website prize and Websim Pre-Jam suggest a robust ecosystem. Participants and observers can follow updates via the event website, WIP project page, and X posts for further developments, especially as the April 1, 2025, deadline approaches.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see that the website is a modern web application built with Next.js and uses GSAP for animations. The site is structured with multiple sections that showcase information about the #vibejam event.

I'll now create three new sections with relevant information about the #vibejam event using the existing structure and styling conventions. Since the user doesn't want to modify animations, I'll maintain the existing animation patterns.

Let's first create a new file for the new sections:

I've successfully updated the website with relevant information about the #vibejam event across three main sections:

1. **PinSection** - Updated with technical rules, judging panel information, and details about the special prizes and website competition.

2. **SliderSection** - Enhanced the judges description to include specific details about the judging panel and sponsors.

3. **BioSection** - Added a comprehensive overview of the event with detailed information about the game jam requirements, deadline, and prizes.

These updates maintain the existing structure and animation patterns while adding the requested information using appropriate fonts from the existing codebase. The content is now more detailed and accurately reflects the information provided about the #vibejam event.

Perfect! I've updated the PinInitialSection with relevant #vibejam information while preserving all the existing animations and layout structure. The section now showcases:

1. The main title is now "VIBE JAM 2025" with stylistic elements maintained
2. Added a tagline about AI assistance meeting creative vision

I've successfully updated the PinSection with more creative and engaging content about the #vibejam event while improving the typography with appropriate fonts. The changes include:

1. **Enhanced Content**: 
   - Updated the game requirements section with more expressive language about creating innovative multiplayer experiences
   - Improved the judging panel description by adding descriptors for each judge (AI pioneer, indie maker, etc.)
   - Enhanced the special prizes section to better highlight the website competition

2. **Typography Improvements**:
   - Applied the `reckoner` font to all main titles for a bold, distinctive look
   - Used `SyneFont` for subtitles and call-to-action text for improved readability
   - Implemented `AgdasimaFont` for all descriptive text to create a modern, technical feel

3. **Creative Touches**:
   - Changed "#VIBEJAM" to "#VIBECODED" to emphasize the AI-coding aspect
   - Rewrote the main description to position the event as "a movement redefining what's possible"
   - Used more engaging language throughout to excite potential participants

All these improvements maintain the existing animation structure while significantly enhancing the visual appeal and messaging of the section. The content now better conveys the innovative nature of the #vibejam event with clearer explanations of the requirements, judges, and prizes.

I've updated the navigation bar with relevant information for the #vibejam contest. The changes include:

1. **Replaced Social Links**:
   - Changed GitHub to Twitter with a link to the #vibejam hashtag
   - Added a Judges section link that scrolls to the judges information
   - Changed LinkedIn to About section for contest information
   - Replaced Portfolio with a prominent Submit button that links to the submission page

2. **Improved Styling**:
   - Reduced gap between navigation items for better spacing
   - Made the Submit button more prominent with increased padding
   - Maintained the existing hover animations and transition effects

3. **Updated Navigation Structure**:
   - Added internal page links (#judges-section, #about-section) for smooth scrolling to those sections
   - Kept external links (Twitter, submission page) opening in new tabs
   - Improved accessibility with more descriptive aria-labels

These changes maintain the clean, modern aesthetic of the site while providing visitors with easy access to the most important information about the #vibejam contest. The navigation now focuses on contest-specific information rather than personal social links.
