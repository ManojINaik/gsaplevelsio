# Fixing Image Stretch in Slider Cards

Looking at the screenshots, I can see that the judge images in the card slider are being stretched and don't maintain their proper aspect ratio. Let's fix this by adjusting the image styling in the `SliderSection.tsx` file.

```tsx:app/sections/SliderSection.tsx
<Image
  className="absolute left-1/2 top-3 h-[92%] w-[92%] -translate-x-1/2"
  src={card.image}
  alt={card.name}
/>
```

The problem is that the images are set to fixed dimensions without considering their original aspect ratio. Let's update the styling to maintain the images' aspect ratio while still fitting properly within the cards:

```tsx:app/sections/SliderSection.tsx
// ... existing code ...
                <Image
                  className="absolute left-1/2 top-3 h-[92%] w-[92%] -translate-x-1/2 object-cover object-center"
                  src={card.image}
                  alt={card.name}
                />
// ... existing code ...
```

By adding `object-cover` and `object-center`, we're instructing the browser to:
1. Maintain the aspect ratio of the images
2. Cover the container area without stretching
3. Position the image at the center 

This change will ensure that all the judge images display correctly without any stretching or distortion, creating a more professional appearance for your portfolio page.

If you need more precise control over individual images, you might want to consider adding specific CSS for each card based on the image aspect ratio, but this solution should work well as a general fix.

# Fixing the Pieter Levels Image Display

Looking at the screenshot, I can see that the `object-cover` property isn't providing the right solution for this particular image. Let's make some specific adjustments for the Pieter Levels card to ensure it displays properly:

```tsx:app/sections/SliderSection.tsx
{cards.map((card) => (
  <div
    key={card.id}
    className={cn(
      "card relative h-[450px] w-[300px] shrink-0 rounded-md bg-black shadow-sm"
    )}
  >
    <div
      className={cn(
        reckoner.className,
        "absolute bottom-[2%] left-[5%] z-[1] whitespace-pre-wrap break-words text-7xl font-extrabold uppercase text-white mix-blend-difference"
      )}
    >
      {card.name.split(" ").join("\n")}
    </div>
    <Image
      className={cn(
        "absolute left-1/2 top-3 h-[92%] w-[92%] -translate-x-1/2 object-cover object-center",
        // Add specific styling for Pieter Levels image
        card.name === "Pieter Levels" && "object-top"
      )}
      src={card.image}
      alt={card.name}
    />

    <div className="absolute bottom-[5px] left-1/2 flex w-[92%] -translate-x-1/2 items-center justify-between">
      <div
        className={cn(SyneFont.className, "text-[10px] text-white")}
      >
        Source - Freepik
      </div>
      <div
        className={cn(SyneFont.className, "text-[10px] text-white")}
      >
        ShinThant
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
))}
```

This change will position Pieter's image from the top instead of the center, which should help crop the image more appropriately.

However, I should note that this particular image appears to show the person in a somewhat inappropriate state for a professional website. A better long-term solution might be to replace the image with a more professional photo of Pieter Levels. If you'd like to replace the image entirely, you could import a different image and update the cards array accordingly.

# Adjusting the Pieter Levels Image Position

To show more of Pieter's face in the image by shifting it to the right, let's update the CSS for his card specifically:

```tsx:app/sections/SliderSection.tsx
<Image
  className={cn(
    "absolute left-1/2 top-3 h-[92%] w-[92%] -translate-x-1/2 object-cover",
    // Customize positioning for Pieter Levels image
    card.name === "Pieter Levels" && "object-position-[60%_top]"
  )}
  src={card.image}
  alt={card.name}
/>
```

Since that custom class doesn't exist, let's modify it slightly to use inline object-position instead:

```tsx:app/sections/SliderSection.tsx
<Image
  className={cn(
    "absolute left-1/2 top-3 h-[92%] w-[92%] -translate-x-1/2 object-cover",
    // Set position for Pieter Levels image to show face
    card.name === "Pieter Levels" ? "object-position-[60%_top]" : "object-center"
  )}
  style={card.name === "Pieter Levels" ? { objectPosition: "60% top" } : {}}
  src={card.image}
  alt={card.name}
/>
```

This should shift Pieter's image 60% from the left edge, which should help show more of his face. You can adjust the percentage (60%) as needed - a higher value will show more of the right side of the image.

If you want to move the image even more to the right, you can increase the percentage value, for example to 70% or 80%.
